    """Modified from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3160699/python-progress-bar/3162864.

    Progressbar is a generator function for the iterable `itr` that displays a progress bar as
    iteration progresses. The statement
        for x in progressbar(itr):
            ...
    is a drop-in replacement for the statement
        for x in itr:
            ...
    at least as far as the behavior is concerned (obviously, output will differ). It is important
    that there is no stdout printing being done in the loop body or in `itr`; the progress bar will
    not be displayed properly if there is.

    `itr` must have a length that is computable a priori via the `len` function; if it does not,
        the keyword parameter `len_estimate` must be supplied. `itr` is the only required
        parameter.

    `prefix`, `suffix`, and `completion` are the messages that should be displayed on the left side
        of the progress bar, the right side of the progress bar, and in the console when the task
        is complete.

    `indicator` and `fill` must each be single-character strings. For "pretty" output, they should
        also print one character wide (the `len` function does not guarantee this fact).

    `total_width`, if not supplied, will be computed as the width of the terminal window in which
        this program is being run, defaulting to 80 if the terminal width cannot be ascertained.

    NOTE: This function has been tested on MacOS and the Zoo. I make no promises that it works on
        other systems.
